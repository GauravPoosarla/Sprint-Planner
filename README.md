# Sprint-Planner
In the world of software development, project success is heavily reliant on careful planning. 

One crucial aspect of project planning in software development is sprint planning. This process involves breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable chunks, and setting specific time frames for completing a set of stories. 

However, planning sprints can be a complex task, particularly with multiple developers and stories with dependencies. This complexity emphasizes the need for utilizing an efficient project management tool that simplifies the sprint planning process.

We propose a web application as a solution that simplifies the sprint planning process. This application has several features that can help streamline project management, including: 

Story Management: The product owner can input all the stories that need to be completed, including their dependencies on each other. Additionally, they can pre-assign developers to specific stories.

Developer Management: The product owner can input the names of all the developers who are available to work on the project, along with their individual capacities. 

Sprint Planning: Once the product owner inputs all the necessary details, the application will plan the sprints with all the stories and developers assigned. This feature ensures that the project timeline is optimized and that all stakeholders are on the same page. 

Visualization: The stories inside sprints can be visualized using two interactive chart options, including Gantt Chart and Dependency Chart. This feature helps users understand the overall progress of the project, identify potential bottlenecks, and adjust the timeline as needed.
